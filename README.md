# Movie Search

A simple project to refresh on using react and building website applications. I chose to lean on Scrimba for a one-hour tutorial on creating a react app that will allow a user to fetch data about a movie.

### Pre-requisite
1. Node v14.10.1
2. Create-react-app v3.4.1

### Getting Started

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/rjiovan/nocode.git
```

Install node_modules
```
yarn install
```
